# thesaurus-rs
A thesaurus library for Rust.

Add to `Cargo.toml`
```
thesaurus = "0.1.3"
```


`thesaurus-rs` is extremely simple library for simple programs that need a thesaurus, but don't need an internet connection. It relies on the JSON file from [zaibacu](https://github.com/zaibacu/thesaurus).

It's simple to use:
```rust
use thesaurus::{WordType, Thesaurus};

fn main() {
    match Thesaurus::synonym("good", Some(WordType::Noun)) {
        Ok(data) => {
            let mut synonyms = String::new();

            for synonym in data.words.iter() {
                synonyms.push_str(&format!("\n    {} ({})", synonym.name, synonym.word_type));
            };

            println!("Word: {}\nSynonyms:{}", data.name, synonyms);
        },
        Err(error) => eprintln!("Error: {}", error),
    };
}
```

Result:
```
Word: good
Synonyms:
    commodity (Noun)
    trade good (Noun)
    goodness (Noun)
```
